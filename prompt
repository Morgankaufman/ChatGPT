prompt: what is a class in javascript
response:  
In JavaScript, think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and behaviors, just like a recipe for making cookies.

Imagine you want to make different types of cookies, like chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal cookies, and peanut butter cookies. Each type of cookie may have different ingredients and instructions, but they all follow the same basic structure of being cookies.

A class in JavaScript is like a cookie cutter that defines how each type of cookie should be made. It contains a set of instructions (methods) and properties that all cookies of that type should have. The class acts as a template for creating multiple cookie objects.

Once you have the class (the cookie cutter), you can create individual cookies (objects) based on it. Each cookie will have its own unique set of ingredients (properties) and can be baked differently (methods) while still following the general structure of the class.

So, a class in JavaScript is like a blueprint or recipe that helps us create and organize similar objects with their own unique characteristics and behaviors.
